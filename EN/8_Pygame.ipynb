    "    - Dichiareremo un *orologio* usando la funzione di pygame `pygame.time.Clock()`. L'oggetto restituito può essere usato per stabilire appunto il frame rate. Ad esempio `clock.tick(50)` definisce che quella istruzione non può essere chiamata più di 50 volte al secondo, ed in particolare definisce che tra due chiamate successive alla funzione *tick* non possono passare più di 20ms.\n",

    "        - *Circle* `pygame.draw.circle(myScreen, color, (x,y), radius, thickness)`. The variable *myScreen* is the screen that we declared at the beginning of the program; the *color* is a triplet of RGB values (Red, Green, Blue) determining the color of the circle; (x,y) are the coordinates of the circle center; *radius* is the radius of the circle; *thickness* is the thinkness of the circle border. (if missing the circle is completely filled).\n",
    "        - *Rectangle*: `pygame.draw.rect(myScreen, color, Rect, thickness)`. The variable *myScreen* is the screen that we declared at the beginning of the program; the *color* is a triplet of RGB values (Red, Green, Blue) determining the color of the circle; Rect is a list of 4 values representing the x and y position of the upper-leftcorner, and the width and height of the rectangle. As an example `[100, 50, 15, 10]` represents a rectangle with the upper-left corner in position (100,50) and sides 15 (width) and 10 (height); *thickness* is the thinkness of the rectable border. (if missing the rectangle is completely filled).\n",
    "        - Some example of RGB triplets for the colors are:red = (255,0,0); green = (0,255,0); blue = (0,0,255); darkBlue = (0,0,128); white = (255,255,255); black = (0,0,0); pink = (255,200,200)\n",
    "        - Pygame includes also a color map. To use it and thus to declare a color \"by name\" it is enough to type the follwing: `pygame.Color(colorName)`. e.g. `pygame.Color(\"red\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *SCREEN UPDATE*\n",
    "    -  PyGame does not immediatly update the screen with all the shapes that have been instantiated on it. It should be done explicitly at each iteration of the loop using the `pygame.display.update()` function. "
