However only some of them are natively supported by the language (such as `int()`, `round()`, or `abs()` that returns the absolute value of a number). To use the others, we have to use code written by others. That code works as a sort of *library* of additional functions, that in Python are called **modules**.\n",

Some modules are built-in to Python, and other modules have to be downloaded separately. As an example, there are modules to generate random numbers, to have time information, to manipulate images, or to help you drawing plots or writing games (such as PyPlot and PyGame, *we will see them later in the course ;-)*). The list of all the modules can be found on the official Python website.\n",
