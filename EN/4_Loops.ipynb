    "# Loops\n",
    "Up to now, we saw how to execute a sequence of instructions and how to skip some of them using conditional constructs. In this lesson, we are going to see how it is possible to repeat several time a set of instructions. Python provides mainly two different ways to do it: the *for* loop and the *while* loop. \n",

    "## For loop \n",
    "The *for* construct is a way to repeat a set of statements over a group of values. The group of values can be composed of numbers, characters end other types of element (e.g. element in a list, as we will see later). generic structure of a for loop is the following:\n",

    "    statements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to iterate is by using a group of values composed by numbers generated by a numeric sequence.  \n",
    "In Python, the simples way to generate a numeric sequence is by using the function `range()`. \n",
    "This function, if used with a single parameter (i.e. `range(number)`), creates a sequence of numbers, starting at 0 and ending at *number* using 1 as step.\n",

A for loop is a loop of a specific length, whereas a while loop is a loop that is used when you don’t know in advance the exact number of loop iterations. *While loop* repeats the sequence of actions many times until the *controll condition* becomes False. Thus, *while* the *control condition* is *True*, the loop body should be executed. The condition is checked before each execution of the loop body to determine if the new iteration of the loop should be done or not. When it become False, then the loop is terminated and the execution passes to the next statement after the loop body.\n",
